# Assembly interaction with high-level programming languages

These are three simple programs that provide examples of the interaction between assembly and the C programming language:

- [casm1](./casm1/) - call the C function from asm
- [casm2](./casm2/) - GCC inline assembly
- [casm3](./casm3/) - call the asm function from C

To build each program, go to its directory and run:

```bash
make
```
