# Assembly interaction with high-level programming languages

These are three simple programs which provides examples of interaction of assembly and C programming languages:

- casm1 - call C function from asm
- casm2 - gcc inline assembly
- casm3 - call asm function from C

To build each program, go to the directory with it and run:

```bash
make
```
